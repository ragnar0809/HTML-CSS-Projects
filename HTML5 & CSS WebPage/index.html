                            <p>A program is a set of instructions that tell the computer to do various things,
                                 sometimes the instruction it has to perform depends on what happened when it performed a previous instruction. 
                                 This section gives an overview of the two main ways in which you can give these instructions, 
                                 or “commands” as they are usually called. One way uses an interpreter, the other a compiler. 
                                 As human languages are too difficult for a computer to understand in an unambiguous way, 
                                commands are usually written in one or other languages specially designed for the purpose.
